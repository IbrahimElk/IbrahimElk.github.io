## I. Construction Of A Maze 

We will write a formal specification of a maze. We will construct a vocabulary
in order to use it to write a theory such that only valid mazes are models of
the theory.

First, we will clarify some terminology, and introduce the starter
vocabulary. We will work in an $$n \times n$$ grid made up of cells. There are two
top-level type of cells: `empty cells` and `walls`. Each empty cell is either a
regular empty cell, the entrance, or the exit. Each wall is either an outer
wall or an inner wall (although this distinction is merely conceptual, meaning
that there is no separate predicate for inner and outer walls in the starter
vocabulary). This leads to the following starter vocabulary:

```prolog
Vocabulary Vstart {
	type X isa nat
	type Y isa nat
	type Pos constructed from {P(X, Y)}
	Wall(Pos)
	Entrance : Pos
	Exit : Pos
}
```

with the following intended meaning:

- **X** is the set of X coordinates.
- **Y** is the set of Y coordinates.
- **Pos** is a type constructed from X and Y coordinates.
  The origin is located in the bottom-left corner of the grid.
  To refer to a cell with coordinates $$X_i$$ and $$Y_j$$ in our theory, 
  we will use $$P(X_i, Y_j)$$. For example, to refer to the bottom-left square, 
  we will use $$P(0, 0)$$. 
- **Wall(P($$X_i, Y_j$$))** denotes that a static wall is 
  located at position $$P(X_i, Y_j)$$.
- **Entrance = P($$X_i, Y_j$$)** denotes that the entrance to the
  maze is located at $$P(Xi, Yj)$$.
- **Exit = P($$X_i, Y_j$$)** denotes that the exit of the maze is
  located at $$P(X_i, Y_j)$$. 

The Y coordinates corresponds to rows and X to columns.
A valid maze must abide by the following rules.

* The position of the start and end cell are fixed. Relative to $$n$$, 
  which specifies the size of the maze. the entrance is always positioned
  in the bottommost row second column. The exit is always positioned in
  the topmost row, second-to-last column. 
* All cells in the leftmost and rightmost columns, as well as all cells in 
  the bottommost and topmost rows, are walls, except for the entrance 
  and exit cells which never contain a wall. We will refer to these walls
  and only these walls as the outer walls. All other walls are inner walls.
* From each inner wall, an outer wall can be reached through a connection
  of neighbouring inner walls (diagonally adjacent cells are not considered
  neighbours).
* Each empty cell can be reached from the entrance through a connection
  of neighbouring empty cells. 
* The grid does not contain a 2 × 2 block of walls.
* The grid does not contain a 2 × 2 block of empty cells

## II. Solving A Maze

We will make a linear time calculus (LTC) theory that models a simple game
in which a player-controlled character moves through the maze, in search of 
the exit. In what follows, we will specify the intended behaviour of this
dynamic system, after which we will specify the starter vocabulary.

In the first time point of the game, a player character is positioned at the
entrance of the maze, facing upwards. The goal of the game is for the player
character to find the exit. The goal is considered completed when the player 
character has reached the exit. In each time point, the character can move 
to an empty cell that horizontally or vertically neighbours its current position.
The character also has a direction, which is the direction in which the 
character last moved. For instance, after moving a cell to the right, the
character’s direction is to the right. 

The tricky part in finding the exit is
that the player initially has no idea of what the maze looks like; it is 
entirely undiscovered! That is: initially, the entire maze – except for the cells
horizontally or vertically neighbouring the player character’s starting
position – is unknown to the player. As the game proceeds, and the player
character moves through the maze, the maze gradually becomes discovered.

Concretely: in each time point, each so far undiscovered cell that horizontally
or vertically neighbours the player character, turns from an undiscovered into
a discovered cell. This is visualized by the cell turning from a black square
into a square that shows the true contents of the cell. After reaching the
exit (i.e., once the player character is positioned in the same cell as the
exit), the character cannot move anymore. The game can be played through an
interactive visualization. The basic behaviour of the game is illustrated using
this visualization in the following 
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0jhaWw3c-A).  


There is, however, an additional complication to the game: in the search
for the exit, the player might encounter a locked gate blocking the way. 
To unlock a gate, the player must use the appropriate key (while standing
in a position that horizontally or vertically neighbours the gate). Keys
can be found in the maze and picked up by the player, i.e., by simply being in
the same position as the key, the player will possess the key at the next
time point. 

However, not every key matches every gate. Keys and gates both
have numbers. Only the key with the same number as a gate can open that gate.
Notice that this information is not displayed in the visualization, this means
that you might have to try different keys in the visualization until the right
one is selected. When you try to open a gate with a wrong key, 
there are no effects. If the player uses the appropriate key to open 
the corresponding gate, both the key and the gate disappear. The player
can carry up to three keys at once. The basic behaviour of gates and
keys is illustrated in the following 
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deb-YDA-U9M). 

In this video, you can see the player character picking up a key 
(note that the key only goes into the character’s inventory the time 
point after the character entered the same cell as the key), 
which is later used to open a gate. Another example, with two
gates and two keys, is shown in the following 
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3wj4lRciDY).

In this video, 
the player character first picks up a key that does not fit the first 
gate encountered (i.e., when clicking the key in the inventory, the gate
does not open). Later, the player character finds another key that does fit
the first gate, and uses it to open that gate.

This leads to the following starter vocabulary:
```prolog
Vocabulary Vbase {
    type Time isa nat
    Start : Time
    partial Next(Time) isa nat
    
    type X isa nat
    type Y isa nat
    type Pos constructed from { P(X , Y) }
    type Direction constructed from (U , D, L , R)
    
    type Gate isa nat
    type Key isa nat
    Wall(Pos)
    Entrance : Pos
    Exit : Pos
    GateAt(Time, Pos, Gate)
    KeyAt(Time, Pos, Key)
    Discovered(Time, Pos)
    Completed(Time)
    
    PlayerAt(Time) : Pos
    Player Orientation (Time) : Direction
    PlayersKeys(Time, Key)
    
    CanMove(Time , Direction)
    
    I_Gate(Pos, Gate)
    I_Key(Pos, Key)
```
with the following intended meaning:
* **Time** is a set of time points.
* **Start** is the initial time point.
* **Next(t)** is the successor time point of time point t.
* **Direction** is a type constructed from directions U, D, L and R, 
    respectively denoting up, down, left and right.
* **Gate** is a set of gates, each of which is denoted with a natural number.
* **Key** is a set of keys, each of which is denoted with a natural number.
* **GateAt(t, p, g)** denotes that gate g is positioned at position p at time t.
* **KeyAt(t, p, g)** denotes that key k is positioned at position p at time t. 
    Note that a key’s position is not supposed to move along with the player
    after the key has been picked up. In other words, a key’s position remains
    constant for as long as the key has not been picked up. Once a key has been
    picked up, it should not have a position.
* **Discovered(t, p)** denotes that at time t, position p is a discovered position. 
    Note that this is a fluent, not an action. Once discovered, a cell should
    remain discovered for the rest of the game. Undiscovered cells get
    visualized as black squares. Discovered cells get visualized as squares
    that shows the true contents of the cell.
* **Completed(t)** denotes that the exit has been reached by the player 
    character at time t.
* **PlayerAt(t) = p** denotes that time point t the player character is
    positioned in the cell with position p.
* **PlayerOrientation(t) = d** denotes that at time point t the player character
    is facing direction d.
* **PlayerKeys(t, k)** denotes that at time t, the player character is in the
    possession of key k.

* **CanMove(t, d)** denotes that at time t, the player character can move
    in direction d, meaning that there is an empty cell neighbouring
    the player in that direction.
* **I_Gate(p, g)** denotes that in the first time point, gate g is positioned
    at position p.
* **I Key(p, k)** denotes that in the first time point, key k is positioned
    at position p.
* **Move(t, d)** denotes that in time point t, the Move action is performed
    in direction d.
* **Open(t, k)** denotes that in time point t, the open action is performed
    with key k.

Here is once again the full vocabulary and the accompanying theory.
